# The Gaming Room Project

- ### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The client, The Gaming Room, currently has a game called “Draw It or Lose It” which is an Android-based game. They want to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms, attracting many users and increasing profit. 
  
- ### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  One thing I believe I did extremely well in developing this documentation is breaking down the requirements for the client. I broke down the requirements into two aspects: the business side and the technical side. This helps make understanding the design constraint and developing a solution for the client much easier.

  
- ### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  Working through the documents was extremely useful when developing the code because the document clarified the requirements. I could understand the client's needs for this project fully; this helped ensure that what I was doing fit the client's expectations. Furthermore, the document also acts as a roadmap that allows for the development of the code; the roadmap outlines all the required methods that will be needed in the applications.
  
- ### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  If I could choose one part of the document that I could revise, I would work on providing better explanations of the domain model. The reason for selecting the domain model and how it works as an object-oriented program must be clarified and explained. I would first talk about object-oriented programming and how each class represents object-oriented programming. This way, it’s much easier to understand than discussing each class and mentioning OOP at the end.
  
- ### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  It's essential for any project to consider the clients' needs since you're making a product for them, and they need to be satisfied with the product. I understood the client's needs by reviewing the requirements set by the client and reading the business and technical aspects of the requirements. I focus on their most significant requirement and needs and understand that they have a limited budget that will need to be followed. After fully understanding the client's requirements, I was able to pick an operating system that fit their needs while staying affordable and within their budget.
  
- ### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  I approach designing software by understanding the requirements, and then breaking down the different OS as well as their pros and cons, before determining the best options for the client. A technique that I found extremely useful when analyzing a document that I would use in any future project is breaking down the requirements from a technical and business side of things. Usually when analyzing an application, people only really take into account the technical side of things, but the business side of things is extremely important too as it helps with making sure the client's requirement is fully understood.
